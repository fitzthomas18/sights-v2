# Sights Lite

A minimal rewrite of Sights, designed to address the steep learning curve, outdated technologies and difficult extensibility of [Sights](https://github.com/sightsdev/sights).

It uses a modern stack: React on the frontend and Python/Starlette/Uvicorn (ASGI) on the backend.

Still in early stages of development.
